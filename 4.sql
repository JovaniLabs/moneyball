--You need to make a recommendation about which players the team should consider hiring. With the team’s dwindling budget,
--the general manager wants to know which players were paid the lowest salaries in 2001.
--In 4.sql, write a SQL query to find the 50 players paid the least in 2001.

--Sort players by salary, lowest to highest.
--If two players have the same salary, sort alphabetically by first name and then by last name.
--If two players have the same first and last name, sort by player ID.
--Your query should return three columns, one for players’ first names, one for their last names, and one for their salaries.

SELECT players.first_name, players.last_name, salaries.salary
FROM players
JOIN salaries ON players.id = salaries.player_id
WHERE salaries.year = 2001
ORDER BY salaries.salary ASC, players.first_name, players.last_name, players.id
LIMIT 50;
