--How much would the Aâ€™s need to pay to get the best home run hitter this past season?
--In 8.sql, write a SQL query to find the 2001 salary of the player who hit the most home runs in 2001.

--Your query should return a table with one column, the salary of the player.

--use 'salaries.year' and 'performances.HR' to verify data
SELECT salaries.salary
FROM salaries
JOIN performances ON salaries.player_id = performances.player_id

WHERE salaries.year = '2001'
ORDER BY performances.HR DESC
LIMIT 1
